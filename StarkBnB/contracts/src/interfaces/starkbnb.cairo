/// The DEV in charge of guests, please write a variable to keep track of guests up, down

/// specific `<up or down>_direction/vote` variable, and send the variable to the `vote` function
/// in the host component, together with the direction the vote would go (a bool value, true for an
/// up vote, or false for a down vote). The component will first assert that the vote variable is
/// not greater than 1, before proceeding with the votes.

/// This can also be checked on the front end to avoid unnecessary gas
